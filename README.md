# AnalyzeTransactionData

Recently we won first place in 2017 big data analytics symposium competition which was introduced by Siemens wind power company. The dataset was the transaction data for the failure of different wind turbines. The contest was about finding unsupervised patterns in the dataset. We used many different strategies to transform the data so that we can apply different methods on it.

We used many well-known techniques like clustering and association rules mining as well as some less known techniques like sequential pattern mining and network analysis. Some of the team members were responsible for applying classic statistical methods like ANOVA, Markov Chain, and path analysis.

Since our findings were interesting and moreover when it comes to transaction data sometimes data scientist need more sophisticated approaches to cope with data transformation, we decided to share some part of our findings.
